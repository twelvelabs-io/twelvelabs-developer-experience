# Twelve Labs Developer Experience
The Twelve Labs Video Understanding Platform uses state-of-the-art ("SOTA") video understanding foundation models that process contextual, spatial, and temporal information in your videos. 

This repository contains quickstart guides and other resources that show how you can integrate the capabilities of the platform into your applications.

## Get started

To use the platform, you need an API key:
1. If you don't have an account, [sign up](https://playground.twelvelabs.io/) for a free account. No credit card is required to use the Free plan. This plan allows you to index up to 600 minutes of videos, which is sufficient for a small project.
2. Go to the [API Keys](https://playground.twelvelabs.io/dashboard/api-keys) page.
3. If you need to create a new key, select the **Create API Key** button. Enter a name and set the expiration period. The default is 12 months.
4. Select the **Copy** icon next to your key to copy it to your clipboard.

## Start building 

Explore these quickstart notebooks containing complete, executable code that you can customize and extend:
